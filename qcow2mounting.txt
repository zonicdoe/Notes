Mounting an Android Virtual Device file system in Ubuntu (qcow2 image).

1.- Check if you have "qemu-utils" installed in your system:
    $ qemu-nbd --help

  If you get something like "Command 'qemu-nbd' not found", then proceed to install "qemu-utils" with:
  $ sudo apt install qemu-utils
  Otherwise, skip this part.

2.- Load and setup NBD (network block device) kernel module. The default "max_part" of NBD is set to 0, so you have to set this number to a safe number depending on the number of partitions you're gonna mount.
In case you are not sure, set it up to 4 as follows:
  $ sudo modprobe nbd max_part=4

3.- Connect the qcow2 image as a network block device.
  For this step, you need to specify the full path to the system image of your Android Virtual Device.
  In this example, the virtual device is named "Zona", so under the avd folder it appears as "Zona.avd" and the full path to the system image is "~/.android/avd/Zona.avd/system.img.qcow2".
  Then, you need to determine the name of the device. In this case, it's the first device that will be connected, so the name will be "nbd0".
  If this was the second device to be connected, it will be "nbd1", and so on.
    $ sudo qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 ~/.android/avd/Zona.avd/system.img.qcow2

4.- Check the partition that you want to mount.
  You can list the partitions of the Android Virtual Device with "fdisk" using the connected device name from the previous step.
  In this case, it is "nbd0", so:
    $ sudo fdisk /dev/nbd0 -l

  In this example, the only partition of the device is listed as follows:
  Device      Start     End Sectors  Size Type
  /dev/nbd0p1  2048 5244927 5242880  2.5G Linux filesystem

  So, "/dev/nbd0p1" is the partition that will be mounted in the next step.

5.- Mount the partition from the Android Virtual Device.
  If you haven't created a mounting point for your partition you can create a folder for that purpose.
  For this example, a folder named "android" will be created under "/media", but you can create the folder in some other part on your system:
    $ sudo mkdir /media/android

  Now, mount the partition specifying the name (from step 4) and the mounting point (the full path of the folder):
    $ sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 /media/android/

  Now you should be able to access the content of the Android Virtual Device:
    $ ls /media/android/
